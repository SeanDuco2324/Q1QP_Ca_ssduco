            <p>To conclude this research, let's evaluate the statistics presented. It can be observed that the rock genre is the prevalent favorite genre of music of the respondents, with 26% of the respondents or 188 out of 736 respondents liking this genre. In contrast to this, Latin seems to be the least preferred music genre, with only 3 respondents answering that this is their favorite genre. 
                As we can also observe in the data, the largest portion of the respondents have an anxiety level of 7, with 17% of the respondents falling under this category. Meanwhile only 1 respondent has an anxiety level of 7.5.
                Now, can we say that music and anxiety have a relationship? 
               </p>
               <p>Based on the data collected, we can conclude that different music genres have varying effects on anxiety. For example, people who listen to rock music tend to have higher anxiety levels than those who listen to other genres. Age can also affect anxiety, as it can be observed in the data that people in their late teens have a higher anxiety level.</p>
               <p>Studies show that music can indeed impact our mood, affecting chances of depression and anxiety. These emotions can also depende on genre,style, or time spent on listening to music. If you are easily stressed or irritated, and you listen to aggressive genres of music, it may be best to switch genres to see how this affects your mood later on.</p>
               <p>Overall, can have a big impact on anxiety. It can either calm us down or worsen our moods. It depends on what we listen to and how much we listen to it. </p>
