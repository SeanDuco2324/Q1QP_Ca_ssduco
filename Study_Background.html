        <p class="paragraph">While researching for our Stat project, we came across this data set that had an interesting topic. The data in this dataset was collected through a Google form that was disseminated through various platforms like Reddit Forums and Discord servers. It was even advertised in public places like libraries and parks through posters and so-called "business cards". The survey was made brief so that as many people can answer as soon as possible. The data collectors also made certain questions optional for this same reason.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"> This dataset contains 4 variables among others that we excluded for simplicity purposes. To be more specific, we included 2 qualitative variables and 2 quantitative variables. Our qualitative variables are the favorite music genres of the respondents, and their anxiety levels on a scale of 1-10. Four our quantitative variables, these are the ages of the respondents, and how much they listen to music, measured in hours per day.  </p>
